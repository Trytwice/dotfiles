### Dotfiles
---
This repository hosts the dotfiles i use in my daily life. They should be cloned to your home directory so that the path is ~/dotfiles/.The install.sh script does two things:  
1. backup your config files to ~/dotfiles_old.(if exist)
2. copy my config files for awesomewm & tmux & vim & urxvt & zsh to you.

### Installation
---
git clone https://github.com/Trytwice/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles && cd ~/dotfiles && ./install.sh
