### Dotfiles
---
This repository hosts the dotfiles i use in my daily life. They should be cloned to your home directory so that the path is `~/dotfiles/`.The script install.sh does two things:  
1. backup your config files to `~/dotfiles_old`.(if exist)
2. copy my config files for `awesomewm` & `tmux` & `vim` & `urxvt` & `zsh` to you.

### Installation
---
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Trytwice/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles && cd ~/dotfiles && ./install.sh
```
